# Cursor_movement_using_eyes
The main objective of this project is to move the cursor through the eyeballs. Library used: OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyautoGUI Language used: Python

We can easily move the cursor with the help of human eyes. We can click any button using just blinking of an eye.
In this project we used 3 libraries in python. 
OPEN-CV library: OpenCV library is used for Image processing.
Mediapipe library: This library is used for detect the face and eventually it detects the eyes too like winking and movement of eyes.
PyautoGUI library: This library is used for image processing and read the camera through CV2 package.
We divided this project in total 5 parts. 
First one is opening the camera. for open the camera and for image processing we used OpenCV library.
Second one is for to detect the face. For detect the face in project we used mediapipe library. In this part we shown multiple facial hotspots.It helped us in to detect the face and fetch the face.
